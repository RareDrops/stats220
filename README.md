# STATS220
This is my repo for **STATS 220**. 

## Introduction


A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more how to deal with data
- I am interested in learning about:
  1. Web Scraping
  2. Web-based Dynamic reporting systems
  3. Creating visual-based communications.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about *my university studies*
