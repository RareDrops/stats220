# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more how to deal with data
- I am interested in learning about Web Scraping, Web-based Dynamic reporting systems, Creating visual-based communications.
